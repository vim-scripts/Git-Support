Integration of Git for Vim/gVim:
- use Git from within Vim and eliminate the need for context switches
- quickly add the file in the current buffer or show its diff
- the output of commands like "git status" is redirected into buffers
- ... the commit can be manipulated from right there
- show the stash, logs, branches, tags, remotes, ...
- show the Git help in a buffer, or open it in the browser
- each buffer comes with a short help: press <SHIFT+F1>
- run arbitrary Git commands and optionally redirect their output into a buffer
- start gitk with arguments: :GitK --all

- comes with a menu, which also severs as an overview of the plug-in's functionality
- custom menu for often used combination of arguments
- configurable syntax highlighting designed to match Git's own highlighting
- automatic folds for diffs and logs
